# elver-bot-discord-js

## instructions
Create your own `.env` file like the `.env.sample` and put your application token and the bot's user id.

To make Discord recognise your commands, you should run `node reboot_endpoints.js`, that will automatically add all commands from the `commands` folder to discord, check the ones provided as examples.

You can start the bot through the console with `node index.js` or by opening `run.bat` in windows and `run.sh` in in linux.
